## Hi there 👋, I am Devan K S

## 🎯About me:

Computer Science and Engineering graduate from NITC with a passion for challenges. I am working as a full stack developer in Ford Smart Mobility. I aim to learn more about different architecture paradigms and help in designing high-quality systems. My career aim is to become a software architect.

## 🔭 Teams I have worked with:
* Office Ride
* Ford Fleet Marketplace
* Integrated Fleet Marketplace - Vehicle Fleet Management
* OCPP Next Gen (Working here presently)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning 

Majorly I have been investing in learing Kubernetes. The idea of using pods and containers for most purposes seemed interesting to me.
My small experience working with our Jenkins builds which ran on pods helped me understand enough to get me curious.
I would love to talk to more experts of the topic.

## 💬 Ask me about:

I am mostly experienced in backend. Creating a number of backend microservices at Ford made me gain a lot of knowledge on Java, Spring Boot and PCF.
Ping me if you have any questions on it. If I am not sure of your questions, I can atleast point to the right SMEs.
