## Hi there 👋, I am Devan K S

## 🎯About me:

Computer Science and Engineering graduate from NITC with a passion for challenges. I am working as a Technical Lead in Ford Smart Mobility. I aim to learn more about different architecture paradigms and help design high-quality systems. My career aim is to become a software architect.

## 🔭 Teams I have worked with:
* Office Ride
* Ford Fleet Marketplace
* Integrated Fleet Marketplace - Vehicle Fleet Management
* OCPP Next Gen
* OCPP 1.6 (Working here presently)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning 

* Majorly I have been investing in learning Kubernetes. The idea of using pods and containers for most purposes seemed interesting to me.
* My small experience working with our Jenkins builds which ran on pods helped me understand enough to get me curious.
* I would love to talk to more experts on the topic.

## 💬 Ask me about:

* I am mostly experienced in backends and architectural patterns.
* Creating a number of backend microservices at Ford made me gain a lot of knowledge on Java, Spring Boot, PCF, and GCP.
* Working on GCP with Ford's transformational plans has given me strong insights into cloud-native architectural patterns as well.
* Feel free to ping me if you have any questions about it.
* If I am not sure of your questions, we can also work together to research them.

## 👨‍💻 Technologies experienced in:

### Platforms

* Minimal experience in Azure
